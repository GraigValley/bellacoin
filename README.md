Update
-------

BellaCoin's original initiatives came at a time unfortunately when the world wasn't as aware or accepting of crypto currencies or blockchain technology.
Another team has taken over develoment, and the original team and its associates and developers are no longer part of the project in any form.
The new official repo can be found at: https://github.com/theambiafund/belacoin
