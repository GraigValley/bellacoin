** NOTE **

If you are running Debian (Xubuntu, Ubuntu should work just fine too), you can just run the following from this directory:
perl installer.pl


See doc/readme-qt.rst for instructions on building BellaCoin-Qt,
the intended-for-end-users, nice-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of BellaCoin.

See doc/build-*.txt for instructions on building BellaCoind,
